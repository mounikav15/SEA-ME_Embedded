# PiRacer Assembly Guide

This document provides a basic guide on how we assembled the PiRacer. All the components were provided by [Waveshare](https://www.waveshare.com/), and this guide is based on their [PiRacer Assembly Manual](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/PiRacer_Assembly_Manual).

## Before You Start

Before starting this guide, you will need the following components:

1. Raspberry Pi (in our case, we used the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B)
2. PiRacer kit
3. Micro SD card (with Ubuntu desktop OS installed)
4. Additional sensors or components as needed

## Assembly Steps

1. Prepare all components from the PiRacer Kit.
2. Start assembling the main body of the PiRacer. For detailed assembly process, please refer to the [Waveshare guide](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/PiRacer_Assembly_Manual).
3. Connect the Raspberry Pi to the piracer's servo using 6pin gpio and connect all the necessary wires.
    Check Raspberry Pi and piracer's GPIO map.
4. Finally, insert the Micro SD card into the Raspberry Pi to complete the assembly.

## Precautions

- All assembly procedures should be done with the power off to avoid electric shock.
- Please assemble the components with care. Incorrect assembly could damage the components.
- Please keep the components safe and turn off the power when not in use.
